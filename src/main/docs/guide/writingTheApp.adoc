We are going to write a simple application with logging.  For a simple concept, we will create a `Person` domain object with a
`name` and `age`. The application will log "friendly" advice for the person based on age.  Through this contrived example, we will
develop tests that verify the correct logging events occur.

First, let's configure the application to only log items pertinent to the exercise.  In `logback.groovy`, delete the line at the bottom
of the file: `root(ERROR, ['STDOUT'])`. Then add the below snippet. This will activate loggers in the package `demo`.
