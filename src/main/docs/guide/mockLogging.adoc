https://projects.lidalia.org.uk/slf4j-test/[Slf4j Test] is a test implementation of Slf4j that stores log messages in memory and provides methods to retrieving them for verification.
It is basically a substitute implementation and should be the only one on the test classpath. To achieve this, declare the dependency and also
exclude the Logback dependency from the testCompile build phase.

[source, groovy]
.build.gradle
----
dependencies {
    ...
include::{sourceDir}/build.gradle[tag=slf4jDependency]
}
----

[source, groovy]
.build.gradle
----
include::{sourceDir}/build.gradle[tag=excludeLogback]
----

In addition, we will be using the `RestBuilder` for testing. Add this dependency below.

[source, groovy]
.build.gradle
----
dependencies {
    ...
include::{sourceDir}/build.gradle[tag=restclient]
}
