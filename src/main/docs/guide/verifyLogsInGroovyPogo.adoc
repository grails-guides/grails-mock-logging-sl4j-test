Slf4j Test handles POGO objects in the same fashion. In `AgeAdvisor`, recall the logger is established with the `@Slf4J` annotation.
This does not alter the approach to verifying logs events.

<1> In a POGO which uses `@Slf4j` Annotation, we simply retrieve the logger in the same manner.
<2> Note we are able to validate multiple log events.
